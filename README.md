# Chronos - Timer and scheduler

# Chronos has changed name to Timexe. 
please visit the new reposotory at https://github.com/paragi/timexe

The new reposotory is initially 100% compatible to this one, as of ver 0.9.6
you just have to replace: 

```js
var chronos = require('e-chron');
```

With

```js
var chronos = require('timexe');
```
